  <h2>Local Environments</h2>
  <p>
    This environment is typically used for development, testing, and debugging purposes, allowing developers and designers to work on and modify the website without affecting the live version. It involves installing a software stack like XAMPP that includes an Apache server, MySQL database, and PHP, which are necessary to run WordPress. This local setup allows for quicker development, as changes can be immediately seen without the need for uploading files to a server. Ensuring that the live site remains stable and unaffected by any potential issues. Once the development or testing is complete, the site can be migrated from the local environment to a live hosting server for public access.
