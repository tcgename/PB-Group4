# Coding
**PHP**  PHP is a widely-used, open-source scripting language especially suited for web development. Embedded into HTML, it enables the creation of dynamic and interactive websites. PHP scripts are executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client's browser, allowing for the creation of content that can change each time the page is loaded.It's known for its ease of use for beginners, yet powerful enough for advanced programming, making it a popular choice for web developers. 

# Further Development
To facilitate ongoing development and customization of our website, we employ to using the child themes of our site. Child themes in WordPress are a method of customizing and enhancing a parent theme without altering its original code, offering a blend of safety, flexibility, and ease of use. They inherit the functionality and styling of the parent theme, allowing for customization in design and functionality without the risk of losing changes during updates. Creating a child theme is straightforward, typically requiring only a stylesheet and a functions.php file. This approach is considered a best practice in WordPress development, as it maintains the integrity of the parent theme while providing a safe environment to experiment with different designs and functionalities. However, the effectiveness of a child theme largely depends on the proper coding of the parent theme and can slightly impact site performance depending on how it's coded.


# Theme Origin
**Underscores.me** It's a popular starter theme for WordPress, designed for developers as a base to build upon and customize for unique website designs. It's a lightweight and minimalistic framework that provides a solid foundation for developing WordPress themes. Underscores comes with a well-organized set of PHP, CSS, and JavaScript files, making it easy for us to understand and modify. It adheres to WordPress coding standards and best practices, ensuring compatibility and efficiency. The theme includes essential templates and functions, but lacks styling and design elements, which encourages developers to create their own unique look and feel. It's particularly favored for its clean, efficient code and responsive layout, which forms an ideal starting point for both simple and complex WordPress themes. By using Underscores as a template,  we can significantly speed up their development process, focusing more on customization and creative design rather than on building everything from scratch.

# Theme Features
The theme follows several guidelines in the building of a theme template, where the whitespaces had been managed identically, and the padding and margin all remain exactly the same for every single page. This was to ensure uniformity and cleanliness throughout the entire site.

# Design
Our website's design aesthetic centers around delivering a clean and uncluttered user experience. By prioritizing minimalism and a uniform colour scheme, we create an environment that focuses on essential information while maintaining an appealing visual appeal. This documentation outlines key design elements, such as a text-centric approach, limited use of images, and consistent margins and padding across all pages and viewports.

**Text Centric Approach**: To ensure a content-driven experience, we have intentionally placed emphasis on textual information throughout the website. By presenting information primarily through well-crafted and concise text, we allow visitors to easily digest and engage with the content. This approach fosters a sense of clarity and enables users to quickly find the information they seek.

**Limiting Images**: While images play a supporting role in enhancing the textual content, we have intentionally avoided cluttering the website with excessive visuals. By judiciously selecting and thoughtfully incorporating relevant images, we strike a balance between providing visual context and maintaining a streamlined design. This approach allows for faster loading times and a focused user experience.

**Clean Visuals**: The website's aesthetic exudes a rustic and clean vibe, promoting a sense of simplicity and elegance. With a carefully curated colour palette, we maintain a consistent and harmonious visual experience across all pages. By employing neutral tones and understated elements, we create a visually cohesive environment that is pleasing to the eye.

**Uniformity**: To achieve a polished and organized appearance, we have implemented uniform margins and padding on all pages, regardless of the viewport or device. Consistency in spacing ensures a balanced layout and contributes to an overall sense of professionalism. By meticulously maintaining these design principles, we guarantee a visually pleasing experience for all users.

# Typography
**Font**: In order to achieve a visually appealing and user-friendly experience, our website incorporates a standardized font theme. The chosen typeface, 'Montserrat,' stands out for its clean and easily readable structure, making it an ideal choice for enhancing the overall aesthetics and legibility of our content.

**Headings**: For the headings displayed on each section of the website, we have employed a font size ranging from 24 to 28 points or, alternatively, utilized the H2 tag. This deliberate approach ensures that the headings effectively capture attention and provide a clear visual hierarchy, guiding users through the content seamlessly.

**Written Content**: With a keen focus on user convenience, the standardized font size for the majority of the written content has been set to approximately 12 points. This careful selection maintains consistency throughout the website, enabling effortless readability for visitors across various devices and screen sizes.

**Fallback Option**: While 'Montserrat' is our preferred font choice, it is essential to maintain optimal readability even in situations where it may not be available. In such cases, we prioritize using any readable 'sans-serif' font as a suitable fallback option, ensuring that the content remains easily accessible and visually pleasing to our audience.

**Colours**: The colour scheme of a website plays a vital role in creating an engaging and visually cohesive user experience. Our website incorporates a carefully selected palette of primary colours to achieve a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing design. This documentation outlines the specific colour choices and their application throughout the site, ensuring readability and visual appeal.
